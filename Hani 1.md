**Diameter**: 800km
**Gravity:** 0.07G
**Atmosphere:** Very tenuous Helium atmosphere
**Volcanism :** 7 very volcanic

```ad-note
This is used as a relative indicator of volcanic activity on a world. A world with a low volcanism ratio would have few and infrequent volcanic activity while a higher ratio would indicate more frequent and violent eruptions. For com- parison, Earth would currently rate a 5, Mars a 2, and Io an 8.

Surface too unstable for buildings, so the significant mining operations are based on low orbita solarl forges fed by giant mining barges with thousands of crew, materials are slingshotted[^1] out into system with massive solar powered accelerators. 

These are run by  coven of tech priests generally exiled here for screwing up in some way or the other. It is not a prestigious posting. 

Each barge is run by a tribe of miners, a self-contained community in itself.[^2]

[^1]:	Let's note that this would make an awesome weapon if  repurposed for planetary bombardment, so control or disabling it would make a good objective.
